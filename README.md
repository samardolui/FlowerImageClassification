# AI Application for Classifying Flower Images

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. I used this dataset of 102 flower categories, following are a few examples.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

    Load and preprocess the image dataset
    Train the image classifier on your dataset
    Use the trained classifier to predict image content
